    My research focuses on the intersection of climate change,
    finance, and economic policy. I examine how environmental
    risks affect financial markets and government finances.

My research examines how economic systems adapt to technological and environmental disruptions. I study how artificial intelligence is reshaping labor markets, analyzing how workers strategically respond to AI tools and how these technologies affect job performance and market dynamics. I also develop financial frameworks to quantify the economic value of nature-based climate solutions, such as how coastal ecosystems protect property values during extreme weather events.
