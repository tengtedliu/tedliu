#### Abstract

 In this paper I examine how climate change affects sovereign default risks and fiscal policy. Climate change poses increasing risks to investors, yet little is known about the interactions of climate risks, sovereign default, and fiscal policies. My paper distinguishes physical risks (e.g., hurricanes) from transition risks, the potential downside of adjusting to a low-carbon economy. Using panel data of 135 countries over 1995-2018, I show that 1 percentage increase of vulnerability to climate risks can increase sovereign default probability by around 5 percentage points. More importantly, in contrast to prior findings, transition risks from climate change may be more important than physical risks for sovereign default. Using a quantitative sovereign default model, I measure climate risks as natural disaster shocks (for physical risks) and policy uncertainty (for transition risks). Such risks affect output and default probability, and have implications for optimal fiscal policies. The paper's preliminary results suggest that climate risks increase fiscal burden and sovereign default probability
