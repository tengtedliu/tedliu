#### Proposal

There is a growing demand for pricing climate risk and identifying cost-effective solutions, particularly nature-based solutions, to reduce this risk. Unfortunately, there is still a large gap between the demand for this work and the interdisciplinary science to deliver answers. We aim to bring together critical UCSC researchers in coastal ecology, engineering, economics, and policy to rigorously quantify climate risks and the value of nature-based solutions to reduce them to inspire greater investments in them.

Ecosystems provide benefits that society should pay for, but these services are rarely valued rigorously, spatially, and most importantly in the economic terms needed by investors and government agencies. The limited data on benefits to costs has been identified as a major impediment in the advancement of ecosystem-based adaptation (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, 2019).
 Coastline deterioration due to climate change can be reduced through climate adaptation projects such as the protection and restoration of coral reefs, marshes, and mangrove forests.  Such adaptation projects come at a cost, including opportunity costs of alternative use of landscape such as landfill construction, fishing, and sea farming.  These costs occur upfront and are subject to the “tragedy of the commons” problem. The benefits from these projects occur over time, benefit individual agents, and take the form of lower climate-related losses than would have occurred otherwise.  Thus, coastal climate adaptation projects are underfunded, if left to individual economic agents, due to tragedy of the commons, tragedy of horizons, uncertainty about future losses, and steep discounting of future losses.  

The impact of the project will be to produce a verifiable and repeatable approach for calculating the costs and benefits of nature-based, coastal adaptation projects. We will contribute to the development of financial instruments to privately fund such projects that could then be marketed to investors interested in investing in climate finance.
