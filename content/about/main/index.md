  Ted is an economist working on climate change. Through his research, he aims to help measure the financial risks and costs of climate change, in order to manage them and improve the economic resilience of underserved communities. His doctoral dissertation contributes to this goal by focusing on bank lending and sovereign debt default, using a range of statistical and numerical modeling tools. 
  
  At the Coastal Resilience Lab, he works on the pricing and valuation of nature-based projects for climate mitigation and adaptation. Before becoming an economist, Ted originally trained to be an anthropologist. Thanks to this nonlinear path, Ted has gained insights into the value of including indigenous knowledge, and the advantage of interdisciplinary solutions to complex problems like climate change.
